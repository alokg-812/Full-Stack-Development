## Observations in the image:
- `.class` is file outside the JDK.

**Compilation** - Process of converting HLL to MLL at once. <br>
Ques - I have a 10 line HLL code and have errors at line 4, 6, and 10. How many errors are generated by the compiler? <br>
Ans - `3 compile time error`

Scene - 10 HLL code -> 100 MLL code, 13th line error, 25th line error of MLL <br>
Ans - at 13th line, the `execution error` will be generated and no further execution will be done (Interpretation)

# JavaScript:

It was initially a scripting lang and not prog lang. <br>
Ques. What is difference between Programming Language & Scripting Language?
- `Programming Language`- A programming language is a formal language used to develop standalone applications, like operating systems, desktop apps, or games.
- Ex- C, C++, Java, etc...
- `Scripting Language`- A scripting language is generally used to automate tasks or extend the capabilities of existing programs.
- Ex- JavaScript, Python, etc...

| Feature               | Programming Language        | Scripting Language              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Usually compiled            | Usually interpreted             |
| **Use**               | Build apps from scratch     | Automate tasks, enhance apps    |
| **Scope**             | System-level, standalone    | App-level, embedded             |
| **Performance**       | Generally faster             | Slightly slower (interpreted)   |
| **Examples**          | C, Java, Go                 | JavaScript, Python, Bash        |
| **Environment**       | OS or machine-level         | Inside applications (e.g., browser, shell) |

- In day to day life we use scripts like
    - for making folder, we use `GUI(Mouse right click-> create folder)` instead of `mkdir`. MKDIR is a script in our desktop
    - for date, we use `GUI`, instead of `date on command prompt`.
```yaml
C:\Users\alokg>date
The current date is: 24-04-2025

C:\Users\alokg>time 
The current time is:  9:19:21.76
```

- The adaptability of the Javascript lead to its nature as a programming language.

### - JavaScript as Scripting Language:
![javascriptStory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329c93ca-44aa-4937-a923-e0b4a56e3511)

- The JIT compilation loads the code into the memory `Just In Time Compilation`
### - JavaScript as Programming Language:



- HLL is converted into bytecode internally even before the request has been shooted, if the bytecode starts after request shoot, time consumption happened.
- `Just Ahead of Time Compilation`, third party compiler is used to convert the code before the request shooting, here, we will use `Babel` for compilation.
- When request is shooted, only interpretation is done.



> Javascript is a light weight & interpreted style of executable code.
