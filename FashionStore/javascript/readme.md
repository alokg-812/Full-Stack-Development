## Observations in the image:
- `.class` is file outside the JDK.

**Compilation** - Process of converting HLL to MLL at once. <br>
Ques - I have a 10 line HLL code and have errors at line 4, 6, and 10. How many errors are generated by the compiler? <br>
Ans - `3 compile time error`

Scene - 10 HLL code -> 100 MLL code, 13th line error, 25th line error of MLL <br>
Ans - at 13th line, the `execution error` will be generated and no further execution will be done (Interpretation)

# JavaScript:

It was initially a scripting lang and not prog lang. <br>
Ques. What is difference between Programming Language & Scripting Language?
- `Programming Language`- A programming language is a formal language used to develop standalone applications, like operating systems, desktop apps, or games.
- Ex- C, C++, Java, etc...
- `Scripting Language`- A scripting language is generally used to automate tasks or extend the capabilities of existing programs.
- Ex- JavaScript, Python, etc...

- In day to day life we use scripts like
    - for making folder, we use `GUI(Mouse right click-> create folder)` instead of `mkdir`. MKDIR is a script in our desktop
    - for date, we use `GUI`, instead of `date on command prompt`.
```yaml
C:\Users\alokg>date
The current date is: 24-04-2025

C:\Users\alokg>time
The current time is:  9:19:21.76
```

- The adaptability of the Javascript lead to its nature as a programming language.
