## Observations in the image:
- `.class` is file outside the JDK.

**Compilation** - Process of converting HLL to MLL at once. <br>
Ques - I have a 10 line HLL code and have errors at line 4, 6, and 10. How many errors are generated by the compiler? <br>
Ans - `3 compile time error`

Scene - 10 HLL code -> 100 MLL code, 13th line error, 25th line error of MLL <br>
Ans - at 13th line, the `execution error` will be generated and no further execution will be done (Interpretation)

# JavaScript:

It was initially a scripting lang and not prog lang. <br>
Ques. What is difference between Programming Language & Scripting Language?
- `Programming Language`- A programming language is a formal language used to develop standalone applications, like operating systems, desktop apps, or games.
- Ex- C, C++, Java, etc...
- `Scripting Language`- A scripting language is generally used to automate tasks or extend the capabilities of existing programs.
- Ex- JavaScript, Python, etc...

| Feature               | Programming Language        | Scripting Language              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Usually compiled            | Usually interpreted             |
| **Use**               | Build apps from scratch     | Automate tasks, enhance apps    |
| **Scope**             | System-level, standalone    | App-level, embedded             |
| **Performance**       | Generally faster             | Slightly slower (interpreted)   |
| **Examples**          | C, Java, Go                 | JavaScript, Python, Bash        |
| **Environment**       | OS or machine-level         | Inside applications (e.g., browser, shell) |

- In day to day life we use scripts like
    - for making folder, we use `GUI(Mouse right click-> create folder)` instead of `mkdir`. MKDIR is a script in our desktop
    - for date, we use `GUI`, instead of `date on command prompt`.
```yaml
C:\Users\alokg>date
The current date is: 24-04-2025

C:\Users\alokg>time 
The current time is:  9:19:21.76
```

- The adaptability of the Javascript lead to its nature as a programming language.

### - JavaScript as Scripting Language:
![javascriptStory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329c93ca-44aa-4937-a923-e0b4a56e3511)

- The JIT compilation loads the code into the memory `Just In Time Compilation`
### - JavaScript as Programming Language:

- HLL is converted into bytecode internally even before the request has been shooted, if the bytecode starts after request shoot, time consumption happened.
- `Just Ahead of Time Compilation`, third party compiler is used to convert the code before the request shooting, here, we will use `Babel` for compilation.
- When request is shooted, only interpretation is done.

> JavaScript is `light weight interpreted` and `Just-in-Time Compiled` programming language.
> * Light weight refers to memory occupied and how heavy the application is.
> * Interpreted refers to line by line translation.


Compiled refers to translating entire program, all lines of program are translated simultaneously at the same time.
1. `JIT [Just-in-Time]` is the process where JavaScript is loaded into browser and compiled in browser. [This happens when the user sends the request]
2. `ADT [Ahead-of-Time]` is the process where JavaScript is compiled and processed at application level. [Even before the request comes this process would happen]


We can use various engines and compilers:
1. Ivy
2. Babel
3. Node
4. V8

JavaScript supports various programming techniques and approaches
* Structural Programming
* Functional Programming
* Imperative Programming
* Object Oriented Programming
> Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language, It supports only few features of OOP.

JavaScript is a programming language, which is used at different layers of our projects
1. Client Side: with HTML
2. Server Side: with Node 35
3. Database: MongoDB
4. Animation Tools: Flash, 3DS Max, etc..

Frontend ==> Backend ==> Database <br>

FAQ1. What are the issues of Javascript? <br>
Ans: 
1. JavaScript is not `strongly typed`
(No data types enforced on a variable)

```javascript
a = 10;
a = "sachin";
a = false;
a = 13.5;
```

2. JavaScript is not `strictly typed`
(It allows using variables without declaring them)

```javascript
"use strict";
a = 10;
```

3. JavaScript doesn't enforce `uniform data structure`
(Inconsistent data properties can exist together)

```javascript
[
  {
    Name: "samsung", price: 45000
  },
  {
    Product: "LG", cost: 55000
  }
]
```
* JavaScript is not secured and it can be blocked by the browsers.

**Examples:**
- *Trojan*: Installing a virus via JavaScript can allow control of a device (Bad approach).
- *TeamViewer*: Installing remote access software properly can allow control of devices (Good approach).

# Day 2

JavaScript Client Side-
=================
1. The main purpose of JavaScript at Client side is to avoid burden on the server.
2. It can improve the performance of the application by managing the various interactions client side.
3. Interactions at the Client Side includes

	a. DOM Manipulations
		- Adding Elements into page
		- Remove Elements from Page
		- Update Data into Elements
		- Configuring styles to elements dynamically.
		- Configuring events to elements dynamically.

	b. It is used for validations[Verify the user input]

	c. Client Side 
		- Managing Client Memory.[username and password stored in cache memory]
		- Managing Client Devices.[Booked the ticket and now print the ticket so we don't need internet].
		- Managing the locations of the user[websites ask for location].
		- Sharing of data with other applications on client device.



FAQ: 
 1.   What is the MIME type for script?	
Ans.
```javascript
    <script type='text/javascript'> :: bulk loading
	<script type='text/module'>     :: module based loading(performance is high)
```
 3.   What is difference between script in head and body?
Ans.
```javascript
     head ---> script would be loaded into browser memory and later used in the page
     body ---> script would be loaded directly into the page and it is not a part of browser memory.
```
 5.   How JavaScript converts Static DOM into Dynamic DOM?
Ans.
```javascript
          HTML -----> HTML parser ----> Static DOM
          CSS  -----> CSS  parser ----> use static DOM and change the style of an element using CSSOM.
	      JS   -----> Javascript engine -----> use STATIC DOM and converts into Dynamic DOM using 'events and functions'.
```

 7.   What is strict mode for JavaScript?
Ans.  without declaring a variable, if we dont' want javascript to permit the usage of variables then we need to go for `strictmode`
	eg:: ```javascript
             <script type="text/javascript">
        		"use strict";
        			a = 10;
        			console.log(a); //uncaught ReferenceError : a is not defined	
    	     </script>
          ```

 9.   How to target JavaScript for Legacy browsers? [Old Version Browsers]
Ans.  Developer can target new JavaScript code to the legacy browser by enclosing the code in HTML comments.

Syntax:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascirpt">
	<!--
		"use strict";
			......
			......
	-->
</script>
```

 6.   How to link external javascript file to html?
Ans.
```javascript
       <script src=''>
       </script>
```
