## Observations in the image:
- `.class` is file outside the JDK.

**Compilation** - Process of converting HLL to MLL at once. <br>
Ques - I have a 10 line HLL code and have errors at line 4, 6, and 10. How many errors are generated by the compiler? <br>
Ans - `3 compile time error`

Scene - 10 HLL code -> 100 MLL code, 13th line error, 25th line error of MLL <br>
Ans - at 13th line, the `execution error` will be generated and no further execution will be done (Interpretation)
