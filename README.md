# 💻 Full Stack Development Repository

This repository contains **all my practice code and experiments** related to **full stack web development**.  
It serves as a learning journal where I explore frontend, backend, databases, and different frameworks.

The code here is **not a single project**, but a collection of:
- Concepts
- Mini demos
- Practice files
- Framework experiments
