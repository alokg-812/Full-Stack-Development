# React Learning

## What is React?
_Ans:_
- React is Javascript library
- React is used to make web front-end application
- With the use of React, we make `SPA(Single Page Application)`.
- Ex:
  - [nasa](https://nasa.gov) is a multi page website, which gets reloaded fully when clicked somewhere.
  - [react](https://react.dev) is a single page webiste.

### Why React JS?
* Fast because of virtual DOM.
* Large comminuty.
* Easy to learn.
* Learning curve is also less compare to other UI technologies.

### More about react:
- Developed by Facebook.
- Current version: `19.1.0`(in march 2025).
- React helps in learning `react native`, helpful for mobile development.

## Why Vite for Project Setup?
- Vite is a fast development server and build tool.
- Efficient production build.
- Simple Configuration.
- Typescript Support.
- Vite supports features like CSS pre-processors, CSS modules.


* Whenever vite is created, the first page that is rendered is `index.html`.

<br>

* index.html's body file further contains two major parts, a `div` with `id="root"` and a script tag with source of `src="/src/main.jsx"`.
* The `src="/src/main.jsx"` calls up the `main.jsx` file.
* Hence the order of loading is something like 
  1. _index.html_
  2. _main.jsx_
* <img width="667" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e7377ac-8228-4dcc-aa50-2fa9eab86546" />

* The `main.jsx`file sets up the starting point of the React app that:
  - Loads styles and main component.
  - Finds the root HTML element (<div id="root">).
  - Renders the app inside that element using React.
* We preferably use Capital letters to give the components name because for the browser, if the component name starts with a small letter, it is just an _HTML Tag_.
  - Components -> Capital letter
  - Tags -> small letter

### App.jsx

## File and Folder Structure of React App
- Folder Structure
  - Most Important Files
    - `package.json` : The most important file
    - `package-lock.json` 
  - Config Files


### 1. `package.json`
- ðŸ“¦ `package.json` is the heart of any Node.js/ React/ Vue/ project.
- It keeps track of:

| Section                         | Meaning                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                          | Name of your project                                    |
| `version`                       | Version of your app (like `1.0.0`)                      |
| `scripts`                       | Shortcuts to run commands like `start`, `build`, `test` |
| `dependencies`                  | Packages your app **needs to run**                      |
| `devDependencies`               | Packages your app **needs only during development**     |
| `main`                          | Entry point of your project (usually `index.js`)        |
| `keywords`, `author`, `license` | Meta info (optional)                                    |

#### dependencies vs devDependencies
* `dependencies`: Core plugins your app uses (needed even after deployment)
* `devDependencies`: Tools for developers (needed only during coding/testing/building)
* Example:
  * `react` and `react-dom` go into dependencies â†’ We need them to run the app.
  * `eslint`, `prettier`, `vite`, or `webpack` goes into devDependencies â†’ Only needed while writing the code or building the app.


### 2. package-lock.json
As we have project details in our package.json file, the package-lock.json contains the nested details of our project.
- **eg#01:**
<img width="1197" height="1238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca16df7-f69f-4035-b5c2-dbcb5a8e6619" />


## React Components
* What is component?
* How to use component?
* Role of component in a React application
* Writing first react component
* Difference between component and function

**Components are smaller UI parts of any react app** <br>
<img width="1089" height="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7c24b3f-4ecd-49d9-bc5f-ea6f84375afd" />
* Multiple components can exist in a single component.
* Even `App.jsx` is a component which is considered as the root component.
* Components name should and must start with a capital letter like `Header` and not header.
* **eg#:**
  * ```jsx
    function Fruit(){
      return(
        <div>
          <h1>First React Component making</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
    export default Fruit
    ```
* 

### Import and Export in React

The `import` and `export` statements are part of **ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)**, not React itself, but they are fundamental to how React components and files are structured.
1. Default Export/Import
2. Named Export/Import
3. Multiple Export/Import

  
* **a. Default Export/Import**: Each file can have only one `default export`. This is typically used for the main component or function of a file. When importing, we can give it any name we want.

    ```javascript
    function MyComponent() {
      return <h1>Hello</h1>;
    }
    export default MyComponent;

    // In another file
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
    ```

* **b. Named Export/Import**: A file can have multiple **named exports**. They are useful for exporting helper functions, constants, or additional components. When importing, we must use the exact names defined in the source file.

    ```javascript
    // In utils.js
    export const name = 'John';
    export function sayHello() {
      return 'Hello!';
    }

    // In another file
    import { name, sayHello } from './utils';
    ```

* **c. Multiple Export/Import**: We can mix and match default and named exports in a single file.

    ```javascript
    // In MyComponent.js
    export default function MyComponent() {
      return <h1>Main Component</h1>;
    }

    export const name = 'Jane';

    // In another file
    import MyComponent, { name } from './MyComponent';
    ```

### JSX

JSX stands for `JavaScript XML` or `JavaScript Syntax Extension`, both terms are used. The official React documentation refers to it as a "syntax extension to JavaScript" that allows us to write HTML-like markup directly within a JavaScript file.

  * **JSX with Curly Braces `{}`**: Curly braces are a special syntax in JSX that lets us "escape back into JavaScript." Anything inside them is treated as a regular JavaScript expression.
      * **Use Variable with JSX**: We can embed a variable directly into our JSX.
        ```javascript
        const user = 'Alok Gupta';
        const element = <h1>Hello, {user}</h1>;
        ```
      * **Condition inside JSX**: We can use a **ternary operator** for simple conditional rendering.
        ```javascript
        const isLoggedIn = true;
        const button = <button>{isLoggedIn ? 'Logout' : 'Login'}</button>;
        ```
      * **Using Function with JSX**: We can call a function that returns JSX.
        ```javascript
        function getGreeting(user) {
          return <h1>Hello, {user}!</h1>;
        }
        const element = getGreeting('Alok');
        ```
      * **Operations inside JSX**: We can perform mathematical or string operations.
        ```javascript
        const sum = 2 + 2;
        const element = <p>The sum is {sum}.</p>;
        ```
      * **Object and Array with JSX**:
          * **Objects** can't be rendered directly. We would typically access a specific property from an object.
          * **Arrays** of JSX elements are rendered as a list. This is commonly used to render a list of items.
        <!-- end list -->
        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const listItems = numbers.map((number) => <li>{number}</li>);
        const element = <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
        ```
      * **HTML Tag Properties with JSX**: We use curly braces to pass JavaScript values to props. For example, to set an image `src` or an `id` attribute. Note that some HTML attributes are renamed in JSX to avoid conflicts with reserved JavaScript keywords (e.g., `class` becomes `className`, `for` becomes `htmlFor`).

### Click Event and Function Call
  * **Difference between JS Function Call and React Function Call**:
      * In plain JavaScript, we often attach an event listener to an element using `element.addEventListener('click', myFunction)`.
      * In React, we attach an event handler directly to the JSX element using camelCase, e.g., `onClick`. We pass the function itself as the value, **not** the result of calling the function.

  * **Make Function**: We can define a function using standard JavaScript syntax.
    ```javascript
    function handleClick() {
      console.log('Button clicked!');
    }
    ```

  * **Make Button and Click Event**: Attach the `onClick` event handler to a `<button>` element.
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    ```

  * **Call Function on Click Event**: When the button is clicked, React will execute the `handleClick` function.
  * **Call Arrow Function**: It's common practice to use an arrow function directly in the JSX. This is particularly useful for passing arguments.
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click Me</button>
    ```

  * **Pass Params with Function Call**: To pass parameters to a function, we must wrap the function call in an arrow function. If we don't, the function will be called immediately when the component renders.
    ```javascript
    function handleWithParams(name) {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }
    <button onClick={() => handleWithParams('React')}>Click Me</button>
    ```

### Upgrading React Versions

The official React documentation recommends using a package manager like **npm** or **yarn** to manage our project's dependencies.
  * **Check Current Versions in Project**: Use the command line to check the versions of React and React-DOM installed in your project.
      * Using **npm**: `npm list react react-dom`
      * Using **yarn**: `yarn list --pattern "react|react-dom"`

  * **Update React Versions**: To update to the latest stable version, we can use the `install` command with the `@latest` tag.
      * Using **npm**: `npm install react@latest react-dom@latest`
      * Using **yarn**: `yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest`
      * For major version updates (e.g., from v17 to v18), refer to the official **React blog** for a detailed migration guide.


## State in React JS ðŸ§ 

#### Why State is Required
* State is essential for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* React components are designed to be declarative, means we describe what our UI should look like for a given state, and React handles the updates.
* When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new data, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the application's data.
* This is why we don't need to manually manipulate the DOM with functions like `getElementById`.

#### What is State
  * State is a container to store data like a variable. It's an object that holds data that may change over time.
  * This is mutable and dynamic. While state itself is an object, the values it contains can be changed, triggering a re-render.
  * We have to import it when we want to use it. The `useState` hook is imported from the `react` library.
  * It re-renders a component automatically so that data can be visible on the UI. This is the core principle of React's declarative nature. When we call the state update function (e.g., `setCount`), React knows the component needs to be re-rendered with the new value.

#### Difference Between State and a Variable
A standard JavaScript variable inside a component will not cause the component to re-render when its value changes. A `state variable`, however, is special. When we update it using its designated "setter" function, React is notified and triggers a re-render of the component and its children.
  * **Standard Variable:**
    ```javascript
    let count = 0; // A variable
    function handleClick() {
      count = count + 1;
      console.log(count); // Value changes, but UI does not update
    }
    ```
  * **State Variable:**
    ```javascript
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // A state variable
    function handleClick() {
      setCount(count + 1); // Updates the state, and the UI re-renders
    }
    ```

#### What are Hooks?
Hooks are special functions that let us "hook into" React features from your functional components. Before hooks, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. Hooks make it possible to write all our logic in functional components, leading to cleaner, more reusable code.

#### How to Use State
1.  **Import `useState`**: Bring the hook into component file: `import { useState } from 'react';`.
2.  **Initializing the state**: Call the `useState` hook inside your component. It returns an array with two elements:
      * The **current state value**.
      * A **function to update that value**.
      * We use array destructuring to assign these to descriptive names, like `const [name, setName] = useState('Alok');`. The argument you pass to `useState` is the initial value.
3.  **Read the state**: Use the state variable directly in your JSX, like `<h1>{name}</h1>`.
4.  **Update the state**: Call the setter function to change the state. **Do not** modify the state value directly (e.g., `name = 'new name'`).

#### Examples of State
Provided examples for `ReactState` and `Counter` are excellent demonstrations of how `useState` works. They show how to change a string and a number, respectively, and trigger a UI update.

#### State in Different Components
Each component has its own isolated state. A change in one component's state will not affect the state of another, unrelated component. To share state between components, we can "lift state up" to a common parent component and pass the state and the setter functions down as props.

#### Multiple States

A single component can have multiple state variables. The React documentation recommends using multiple `useState` calls for different pieces of state rather than a single state object that holds everything. This makes the code more readable and easier to manage.

```javascript
// Good practice
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Alok');
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Gupta');

// Less common practice
const [user, setUser] = useState({ firstName: 'Alok', lastName: 'Gupta' });
```

#### Interview Question

An interviewer might ask: "Why is `useState` called with an array destructuring assignment?" The answer is that `useState` always returns an array with the state value and the setter function in the same order. This pattern is a convention in React, and it allows you to name the variables anything you want while maintaining the correct order.

### Toggle or Hide and Show in React
#### The React Approach
The React approach to toggling elements is to use a state variable, typically a boolean, to control what is rendered. Instead of manually changing the CSS `display` property, we conditionally render the element based on the state.

#### Defining State
We create a boolean state variable to track the visibility of the element.

```javascript
const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true);
```

#### Updating State on Button Click
On a button click, we call the state setter function to update the boolean. A common pattern is to use the previous state to determine the new state.
```javascript
<button onClick={() => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}>Toggle</button>
```

#### Add Condition for Toggle
We use a **ternary operator** or a logical `&&` operator in your JSX to conditionally render the element. Below example with the ternary operator is a perfect illustration of this.

**example code:**
```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
function Toggle(){
    const [display, setDisplay]=useState(true);
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>Toggling in React JS</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setDisplay(!display)}>Toggle UserName</button>
            {
                display ? <h2>Alok Gupta</h2> : null
            }
        </div>
    )
}
export default Toggle;
```

*Note:* The line `setDisplay()` in our example should be `setDisplay(!display)` to correctly toggle the state.

#### Hide and Show Component
This same principle can be applied to entire components. We can conditionally render a component based on a state value.
```javascript
function App() {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(true);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowComponent(!showComponent)}>Toggle Component</button>
      {showComponent && <MyComponent />}
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, `MyComponent` is only rendered if `showComponent` is `true`. The `&&` operator is a simple way to achieve this.
