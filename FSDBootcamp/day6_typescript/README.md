# TYPESCRIPT

- TypeScript is an enhanced version of Javascript.
- `Superset` of JS
- TypeScript built on JS with some added new features.

> ▶️ Note: <br>
- TS cann't run directly on the browser, it(`TS Compiler`) first converts the code from TS to JS.

**Ques:** If TS converts into JS and then process, what's the benefit to introduce new language?
<br>

## Benefits of TS:
- Check errors on `Compile Time`.
- Datatypes.
- Supports Object-Oriented Programming.
- Well managed code.

**eg#01:**

```js
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
console.log(add('2' + '3')); // 5 but it shouldn't.
```
